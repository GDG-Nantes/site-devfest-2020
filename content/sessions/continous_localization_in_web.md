Internatiolazi, wait, Internationani, wait, i18n.

Who here never lost an entire day making sure our JSON lang files are well synced with the codebase ?

Or had to format/parse between excel files on the translator side and JSON files on our sides ?

This talk would like to present how to step up our i18n game, starting from a simple JSON files based solution to one based on Continous Localization, where merging translations becomes a non event.

You will be able to follow each step we took, their benefits and shortcomings, but also be aware of a few alternative solutions we considered and that might do the job for you.

_Integration samples are written in React over react-i18n, but we believe the takeaways to be framework-agnostic._
